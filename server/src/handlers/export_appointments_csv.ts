  // 1. Query appointments using the same filters as getAppointments
  // 2. Format the data as CSV string with proper headers
  // 3. Include all relevant fields for admin export
  // 4. Handle proper CSV escaping for text fields with commas/quotes
  // 5. Return CSV string that can be downloaded by admin dashboard
  
  // CSV headers should include: ID, Name, Phone, Email, Tests, Preferred Date, 
  // Status, Address, Coordinates, Notes, Created At, etc.
