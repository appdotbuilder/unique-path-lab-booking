  // 1. Query appointments from the database
  // 2. Apply filters (status, date range, search by name/phone/email)
  // 3. Return filtered and sorted appointments (latest first)
  // 4. Support pagination if needed for large datasets
  
  // Filter logic will include:
  // - Status filtering if provided
  // - Date range filtering (startDate to endDate) if provided
  // - Text search across name, phone, email fields if search term provided
  // - Order by created_at DESC for most recent first
